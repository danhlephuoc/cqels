# cqels
This project is automatically exported from code.google.com/p/cqels. The code is for the engine built in 2011 for my paper in ISWC 2011[1]. 
The performance of this engine is not representative for latest version of CQELS engine. I have better results in the paper[2], however, 
I am not able to release the source code of this version of engine. Aiming to have open source Polygot CQELS engines (preferably Apache 2.0), 

I started the project at https://github.com/cqels, hopefull, the prelease of C++ and Java version will be comming out in few months. 

I'm looking for collbobrators to help out, please contact me at danh@danhlephuoc.info.
